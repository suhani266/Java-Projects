# Java-Projects
An ATM Simulator Machine is a Java-based application that mimics the basic operations of a real Automated Teller Machine. The project is mainly used for learning GUI programming, event handling, object-oriented concepts, and exception handling in Java.

The application allows a user to:
>  Firstly select language hindi or english.

>  Log in using a PIN using the exception handling when pin is not correct show the dialoguebox which shows the error message.
1. withdraw amount
2. Chane password
3. select language
4. Exit safely

The ATM simulator reacts to user actions using Event Handling.

>  Concepts Used:
1. ActionListener Interface
2. actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method
3. Exception handling is crucial to make the ATM simulator robust and user-friendly.

>  Common Exceptions Handled:
1. NumberFormatException
2. ArithmeticException
3. NullPointerException

Custom exceptions (e.g., InsufficientBalanceException)
:- Why Exception Handling is Important:
:- Prevents application crash
:- Displays meaningful error messages
:- Ensures smooth user interaction

ATM Simulator Machine is a Java-based application that simulates basic ATM operations like login, balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal. It uses Swing and AWT to create a graphical user interface with buttons, labels, text fields, and dialog boxes. Event handling is implemented using ActionListener to respond to user actions. Exception handling is used to manage invalid inputs, insufficient balance, and runtime errors, ensuring smooth execution. The project demonstrates key object-oriented concepts, GUI programming, and error handling in Java, making it suitable for academic and learning purposes.
